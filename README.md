**Manual Tests**
- Click each answer, correct one makes yaya! sound.
- Next button loads next question.
- Play Again button resets quiz.
- Sounds play on correct/wrong.
- Celebratory confetti appears on 4 rights out of 6 or more score.
- Tested in Chrome, mobile view, and tablet.
- DevTools in Chrome to see any errors in the console. but no errors found.

## How It Works

- Questions and four answers are stored in a JavaScript array.

- On page load, the first question and its answers are displayed.

- The script checks if it matches the correct answer.

- Plays a correct or wrong sound. fart sound or yayya!

- Disables further clicks until proceeding.

- A "Next" button appears to load the next question.

- At the end, the final score and feedback message appear, with a "Play Again" button to restart.

- If the user scores more than half, confetti and a celebration sound play.



## Future Features

- audio sound and some music clips recognition
- API integration
- Add difficulty levels
- Show a timer for each question
- Add more visual feedback (colors, animations)

## Deployment

I published this site using GitHub Pages. Here's how I did it:

1. I pushed all my project files to GitHub in a public repository.
2. Then I clicked on the **Settings** tab in the repo.
3. I scrolled down to **Pages** in the sidebar.
4. Under **Source**, I selected the `main` branch and left the folder as `/ (root)`.
5. After a few seconds, GitHub gave me a link to the live site.

## Performance Testing

Used Chrome Lighthouse to test performance and accessibility.
All scores were above 95+% for mobile and desktop.

Desktop scores:
- Performance: 97
- Accessibility: 96
- Best Practices: 100
- SEO: 100

Mobile scores:
- Performance: 96 (incognito mode)
- Accessibility: 100
- Best Practices: 100


## Testing

I tested the quiz by myself.  
I clicked things and checked if they worked.  
I also looked on different screen sizes and checked my code with online tools.

### 1) Manual tests

**Answer buttons**  
- Expected: Turn green if right, red if wrong. Only one button works for each question.  
- Testing: I clicked a wrong answer, then a right answer.  
- Result: Worked as expected.  
- Fix: No fix needed.  

**Scoreboard**  
- Expected: Go up by 1 if the answer is right, no change if wrong.  
- Testing: I answered 4 questions 2 right, 2 wrong.  
- Result: Worked as expected.  
- Fix: No fix needed.

- Testing: I played until the last question.  
- Result: Worked as expected.  
- Fix: No fix needed.  

**Play again button**  
- Expected: Reset the score and start the quiz again from question 1.  
- Testing: I clicked "Play again" after finishing the quiz.  
- Result: Worked as expected.  
- Fix: No fix needed.  

**Sounds**  
- Expected: Play correct/wrong sound every time. Play celebration sound and show confetti if score is more than half.  
- Testing: I answered quickly and pressed **Next** quickly to see if sound works.  
- Result: Worked after fix.  
- Fix: I stop the sound before playing again.



**Keyboard focus**
- Expected: I can move between buttons with TAB and SHIFT+TAB.
- Testing: Pressed TAB many times, then SHIFT+TAB to go back.
- Result: Worked as expected.
- Fix: No fix needed.

**Responsive check**
- Expected: The quiz should work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Code check**
- HTML: Checked with W3C Validator, no errors found.
- CSS: Checked with W3C CSS Validator, no errors found.
- JavaScript: Checked with JSHint, no big problems found.
- Fix: No fix needed.

**Bugs I found and fixed**
- Bug: Sounds would sometimes play over each other.

**Summary**
The quiz works well. All main features work like planned, it is responsive, and there are no errors in the code validators.
